## TRAVEL PROJECT (Start2Impact University)

Welcome to the S2I Data Science Final Project - Travel!

The main objective of this project is to analyze the customer satisfaction of an airline company. We were provided with two raw datasets - train and test set - which we used to extrapolate information regarding the airline company's business, such as typical customers, flight class, and a rating regarding their service quality.

Our goal is to help the airline company understand how they can improve their services based on a client survey. This will not only increase overall customer satisfaction but also boost revenue, improve the company's image, and enhance their services and products.

To achieve this objective, we will:

1. Analyze and understand the data provided
2. Elaborate a machine learning problem (classification or regression)
3. Train different ML models and study their performance
4. Evaluate the ML models
5. Underline key findings
6. Provide a conclusion, limitations, and suggestions for further investigation.
7. By following these steps, we hope to provide the airline company with valuable insights that will enable them to take the necessary actions to improve customer satisfaction and grow their business.

**Thank you for choosing our team for this project, and we look forward to presenting our findings to you!**
